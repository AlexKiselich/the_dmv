# The DMV

## Reflection:

  **1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.**
  
    My process to debug this code was really focused on trying to understand what the code was trying to do. I went through the lines of code to see if I didn't know what something was (Like look up what gem faraday was doing or what the spec helper file was) and then look up some information on that. Then I started running the tests to see errors.

    I think next time I will try to run tests one at a time rather than all at once to really get abetter feeling on what is happening during each test.  
  
  
  **2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?**

    It is hard to see what the code is trying to do and how the code works at the beginning. The nice thing is you get to see how different code can really be if you didn't write it and sometimes learn new ways to do something but that also can cause problems if the code is doing something and you don't understand how.



  **3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?**


    I think the debugging part was easier than expected when you jump in to an unfamiliar codebase. The error codes and failures help paint a picture of what the code is trying to do and made it much easier to understand.
